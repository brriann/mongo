### $match - FILTERING DOCUMENTS
###

-$match should come as early as possible, and can be used multiple times in an aggregation pipeline
-$match uses standard MongoDB query operators
  -no $where.  $text only allowed at first stage of aggregation pipeline
-$match in the first stage, can take advantage of INDEXES.  SO, $MATCH = FIRST STAGE!!!
-$match does not allow projection.  
-$match is a FILTER, not a find

db.coll.aggregate([{ $match: {} }])

###
### $project - SHAPING DOCUMENTS
###

-$project is like a find projection, and much more. remove/retain fields, reassign fields, combine into new fields
-$project is like a map function - higher order function that transforms a collection

db.coll.aggregate([{ $project: {...} }])
db.coll.aggregate([{ $project: {_id: 0, name: 1} }]) // REMOVE or RETAIN, just like projection in a find
db.coll.aggregate([{ $project: {_id: 0, name: 1, "field.subfieldOnly": 1} }])
